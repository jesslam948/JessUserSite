                <aside>
                    <p><span class="special">Randy Pausch</span> was a Computer Science Lecturer at Carnegie Mellon.
                        He wrote the book <em>The Last Lecture</em> (based off of the Lecturing series of the same name)
                        when he was diagnosed with cancer. I highly recommend this book!</p>

                            I’ve probably logged wayyyy too many hours on these 3 games alone</li>
                        <li>I was also introduced to SV this past year and am already on Summer Year 2 of my farm!
                            I switch between playing casually and going hard-core haha</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>I love love love art</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I especially love works created by modern artists like Yayoi Kusama, Takashi Murakami,
                            and Olafur Eliasson</li>
                        <li>I once spent 4 hours walking around the Louvre by myself!…
                            And somehow still managed to not see everything :(</li>
                    </ul>
